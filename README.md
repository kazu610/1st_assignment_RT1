================================

This Repository is for the first assigmnent of Research Track 1

Introduction
------------

The task we have to accomplish is **to let the robot deliver silver tokens to gold tokens respectively**.

Installing and Running
----------------------

The simulator requires a Python 2.7 installation, the [pygame](http://pygame.org/) library, [PyPyBox2D](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypybox2d/2.1-r331), and [PyYAML](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML/).

If you can't inastall Python-pygame, this command will help you.

```bash
$ sudo pip2 install pygame
```

also, if you encount the error when you try installing pypybox2d, check if python2-dev is installed properly.

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install python2-dev
```

Running
-------

To run the assignment in the simulator, use `run.py`, passing it the file name `assignment1.py`, as the following:

```bash
$ python2 run.py assignment.py
```

In the environment, you will find the components below.
